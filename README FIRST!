This is WPython (codename "CISCy") v1.0alpha, which is based on
Python 2.6.1.

WPython is a re-implementation of (some parts of) Python, which drops
support for bytecode in favour of a word-based model (where a is word is
16 bits wide).

It also implements an hybrid stack-register virtual machine, and adds a of
other optimizations.

For better informations, take a look at the slides which I have presented to
the last PyCon3 at Florence, in Italy. They explain the new architecture
and give some informations about the optimizations.

The next release will come soon (a few days) and let disable almost all of
them, so that some tests can be made to misure the impact of each optimization.

After that and thanks to a suggestion of Antonio Cuni (a PyPy developer),
a change into the implementation of constant folding code for tuples, lists
and dicts will be made, dropping some "hacks" to the Python type system.
This will revert almost all code changes to some modules that implements
the basic types (ints, longs, floats, etc.), moving all code to compile.c.

After these releases, I'll start writing a document giving precise indications
about the code used in each optimization, so it will make easier to write
patches to eventually integrate specific features to other Python
implementations.

What's new in this release?
---------------------------

It's the first release! :)


Distribution structure
----------------------

Same of Python 2.6.1. Only one folder ("codestats") added to Tools, with two
applications that I have used to generate stats to the bytecode (or wordcode)
generated from Lib or Tools folders in the standard library.
Anyway, you can specify files and/or folders to be processed instead, listing
them in the command line.  

That's all, folks!
